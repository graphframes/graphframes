/**
 * A high-level abstraction for working with property graphs that simplifies interaction with the
 * GraphFrames library.
 *
 * PropertyGraphFrame serves as a logical structure that manages collections of vertex and edge
 * property groups, providing a user-friendly API for graph operations. It handles various
 * internal complexities such as:
 *   - ID conversion and collision prevention
 *   - Management of directed/undirected graph representations
 *   - Handling of weighted/unweighted edges
 *   - Data consistency across different property groups
 *
 * The class maintains separate collections for vertex and edge properties, allowing for flexible
 * graph construction while ensuring data integrity. Each property (vertex or edge) handles its
 * data internally, while this class provides a simplified interface for working with the
 * underlying GraphFrame structure.
 *
 * @param vertexPropertyGroups
 *   Sequence of vertex property groups that define the graph's vertices
 * @param edgesPropertyGroups
 *   Sequence of edge property groups that define the graph's edges

   * Converts a heterogeneous property graph into a unified GraphFrame representation.
   *
   * This method transforms a property graph that may contain multiple vertex types and both
   * directed and undirected edges into a single GraphFrame object where all vertices and edges
   * share the same schema. The conversion process handles:
   *
   *   - Internal ID generation and collision prevention by hashing vertex/edge IDs with their
   *     group names
   *   - Merging of different vertex types into a unified vertex DataFrame
   *   - Conversion of directed/undirected edge relationships into a consistent edge DataFrame
   *   - Filtering of vertices and edges based on provided predicates
   *
   * The method allows selecting a subset of property groups and applying filters to control which
   * data is included in the final GraphFrame.
