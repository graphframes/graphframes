The is the officila [graphframes-py PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/graphframes-py/), which is a Python wrapper for the Scala GraphFrames library.
This package is maintained by the GraphFrames project and is available on PyPI.

For instructions on GraphFrames, check the project [README.md](https://github.com/graphframes/graphframes?tab=readme-ov-file#graphframes-dataframe-based-graphs).

See [Installation and Quick-Start](https://github.com/graphframes/graphframes?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-and-quick-start) for the best way to install and use GraphFrames.

## Installation

```bash
pip install graphframes-py
```

**NOTE!** *Python distribution does not include JVM-core. You need to add it to your cluster or Spark-Connect server!*

## Running `graphframes-py`

You should use GraphFrames via the `--packages` argument to `pyspark` or `spark-submit`, but this package is helpful in development environments.

```bash
# Interactive Python, Spark 3.5.x
$ pyspark --packages io.graphframes:graphframes-spark3_2.12:0.9.2

# Interactive Python, Spark 4.0.x
$ pyspark --packages io.graphframes:graphframes-spark4_2.13:0.9.2
```

## Documentation

- [API Reference](https://graphframes.io/api/python/index.html)

## Spark-Connect Note

GraphFrames PySpark is choosing connect or classic implementation implicitly based on the result of `is_remote()`.
To enforce usage of connect-based implementation, you may export this variable `SPARK_CONNECT_MODE_ENABLED=1`
