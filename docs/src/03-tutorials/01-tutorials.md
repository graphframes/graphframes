# GraphFrames Tutorials

This section contains step-by-step tutorials to help you learn and master specific features of GraphFrames.

Currently available tutorials:

* [Motif Finding Tutorial](/03-tutorials/02-motif-tutorial.md): Learn how to perform pattern recognition in graphs using network motif finding. This tutorial demonstrates the technique using the `stackexchange.com` knowledge graph, showing you how to identify and analyze recurring patterns and substructures within the graph data.

More tutorials will be added in future releases to cover additional GraphFrames features and use cases.
