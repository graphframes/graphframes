/**
 * Run static Label Propagation for detecting communities in networks.
 *
 * Each node in the network is initially assigned to its own community. At every iteration, nodes
 * send their community affiliation to all neighbors and update their state to the mode community
 * affiliation of incoming messages.
 *
 * LPA is a standard community detection algorithm for graphs. It is very inexpensive
 * computationally, although (1) convergence is not guaranteed and (2) one can end up with trivial
 * solutions (all nodes are identified into a single community).
 *
 * The resulting DataFrame contains all the original vertex information and one additional column:
 *   - label (`LongType`): label of community affiliation
