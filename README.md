# GraphFrames: DataFrame-based Graphs

This is a package for graphs processing and analytics on scale. It is built on top of Apache Spark and relies on DataFrame abstraction. Users can write highly expressive queries by leveraging the DataFrame API, combined with a new API for network motif finding. The user also benefits from DataFrame performance optimizations within the Spark SQL engine. GraphFrames works in Java, Scala, and Python.

You can find user guide and API docs at <https://graphframes.io>

## GraphFrames is Back

This project was in maintenance mode for some time, but we are happy to announce that it is now back in active development!

## Installation and Quick-Start

### GraphFrames core

GraphFrames scala core and Spark-Connect plugin are published in the Sonatype Central. Namespace is `io.graphframes`.

```bash
# Interactive Scala/Java

# For Spark 3.5.x, scala 2.12
$ spark-shell --packages io.graphframes:graphframes-spark3_2.12:0.9.0

# For Spark 3.5.x, scala 2.13
$ spark-shell --packages io.graphframes:graphframes-spark3_2.13:0.9.0

# For Spark 4.0.x
$ spark-shell --packages io.graphframes:graphframes-spark4_2.13:0.9.0

# Interactive Python, Spark 3.5.x
$ pyspark --packages io.graphframes:graphframes-spark3_2.12:0.9.0

# Interactive Python, Spark 4.0.x
$ pyspark --packages io.graphframes:graphframes-spark4_2.13:0.9.0
```

### GraphFrames Python API

Python API is published in the PyPi:

```bash
pip install graphframes-py
```

**NOTE!** *Python distribution does not include JVM-core. You need to add it to your cluster or Spark-Connect server!*

### GraphFrames Spark Connect

To add GraphFrames to your spark connect server, you need to specify the plugin name, for example:

```bash
./sbin/start-connect-server.sh \
  --conf spark.connect.extensions.relation.classes=org.apache.spark.sql.graphframes.GraphFramesConnect \
  --packages io.graphframes.graphframes-connect-spark4_2.13:0.9.0
  --conf spark.checkpoint.dir=${CHECKPOINT_DIR}
```

**NOTE!** *GraphFrames is relying on iterative graph algorithms and uses checkpoints internally to avoid infinite growing of the Spark's Logical Plan. Spark-Connect API does not provide the way to specify the checkpoint dir and it should be specified via `spark.checkpoint.dir` configuration!*

### Quick Start

Now you can create a GraphFrame as follows.

In Python:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from graphframes import GraphFrame

spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()

nodes = [
    (1, "Alice", 30),
    (2, "Bob", 25),
    (3, "Charlie", 35)
]
nodes_df = spark.createDataFrame(nodes, ["id", "name", "age"])

edges = [
    (1, 2, "friend"),
    (2, 1, "friend"),
    (2, 3, "friend"),
    (3, 2, "enemy")  # eek!
]
edges_df = spark.createDataFrame(edges, ["src", "dst", "relationship"])

g = GraphFrame(nodes_df, edges_df)
```

Now let's run some graph algorithms at scale!

```python
g.inDegrees.show()

# +---+--------+
# | id|inDegree|
# +---+--------+
# |  2|       2|
# |  1|       1|
# |  3|       1|
# +---+--------+

g.outDegrees.show()

# +---+---------+
# | id|outDegree|
# +---+---------+
# |  1|        1|
# |  2|        2|
# |  3|        1|
# +---+---------+

g.degrees.show()

# +---+------+
# | id|degree|
# +---+------+
# |  1|     2|
# |  2|     4|
# |  3|     2|
# +---+------+

g2 = g.pageRank(resetProbability=0.15, tol=0.01)
g2.vertices.show()

# +---+-----+---+------------------+
# | id| name|age|          pagerank|
# +---+-----+---+------------------+
# |  1| John| 30|0.7758750474847483|
# |  2|Alice| 25|1.4482499050305027|
# |  3|  Bob| 35|0.7758750474847483|
# +---+-----+---+------------------+

# GraphFrames' most used feature...
# Connected components can do big data entity resolution on billions or even trillions of records!
# First connect records with a similarity metric, then run connectedComponents.
# This gives you groups of identical records, which you then link by same_as edges or merge into list-based master records.
sc.setCheckpointDir("/tmp/graphframes-example-connected-components")  # required by GraphFrames.connectedComponents
g.connectedComponents().show()

# +---+-----+---+---------+
# | id| name|age|component|
# +---+-----+---+---------+
# |  1| John| 30|        1|
# |  2|Alice| 25|        1|
# |  3|  Bob| 35|        1|
# +---+-----+---+---------+

# Find frenemies with network motif finding! See how graph and relational queries are combined?
(
    g.find("(a)-[e]->(b); (b)-[e2]->(a)")
    .filter("e.relationship = 'friend' and e2.relationship = 'enemy'")
    .show()
)

# These are paths, which you can aggregate and count to find complex patterns.
# +------------+--------------+----------------+-------------+
# |           a|             e|               b|           e2|
# +------------+--------------+----------------+-------------+
# |{2, Bob, 25}|{2, 3, friend}|{3, Charlie, 35}|{3, 2, enemy}|
# +------------+--------------+----------------+-------------+
```

## Note about Python API distribution

`graphframes-py` is our Official PyPi Package

We recommend using the Spark Packages system to install the latest version of GraphFrames, but now publish a build of our Python package to PyPi in the [graphframes-py](https://pypi.org/project/graphframes-py/) package. It can be used to provide type hints in IDEs, but does not load the java-side of GraphFrames so will not work without loading the GraphFrames package. See [Installation and Quick-Start](#installation-and-quick-start).

```bash
pip install graphframes-py
```

**WARNING!**

This project does not own or control the [graphframes PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/graphframes/) (installs 0.6.0) or [graphframes-latest PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/graphframes-latest/) (installs 0.8.4).

**WARNING!**

## Maven and SBT

Maven:
```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.graphframes</groupId>
        <artifactId>graphframes-spark4_2.13</artifactId>
        <version>0.9.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

SBT:
```sbt
libraryDependencies += "io.graphframes" %% "graphframes-spark4" % "0.9.0"
```

**WARNING!**

**=========================**

Due to governance problems and limitations, all the new releases of `GraphFrames` will be published to the Maven Central under the namespace `io.graphframes` (not `org.graphframes`)!

**=========================**

## GraphFrames Internals

To learn how GraphFrames works internally to combine graph and relational queries, check out the paper [GraphFrames: An Integrated API for Mixing Graph and
Relational Queries, Dave et al. 2016](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~matei/papers/2016/grades_graphframes.pdf).

## Building and running unit tests

To compile the core project, run `build/sbt package` from the project home directory.
To compile the Spark Connect Plugin, run `build/sbt connect/package`

## Spark version compatibility

This project is compatible with Spark 3.5.x and Spark 4.0.x. Significant speed improvements have been made to DataFrames in recent versions of Spark, so you may see speedups from using the latest Spark version.
