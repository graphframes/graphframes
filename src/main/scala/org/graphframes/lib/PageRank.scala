/**
 * PageRank algorithm implementation. There are two implementations of PageRank.
 *
 * The first one uses the `org.apache.spark.graphx.graph` interface with `aggregateMessages` and runs
 * PageRank for a fixed number of iterations. This can be executed by setting `maxIter`. Conceptually,
 * the algorithm does the following:
 * {{{
 * var PR = Array.fill(n)( 1.0 )
 * val oldPR = Array.fill(n)( 1.0 )
 * for( iter <- 0 until maxIter ) {
 *   swap(oldPR, PR)
 *   for( i <- 0 until n ) {
 *     PR[i] = alpha + (1 - alpha) * inNbrs[i].map(j => oldPR[j] / outDeg[j]).sum
 *   }
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * The second implementation uses the `org.apache.spark.graphx.Pregel` interface and runs PageRank until
 * convergence and this can be run by setting `tol`. Conceptually, the algorithm does the following:
 * {{{
 * var PR = Array.fill(n)( 1.0 )
 * val oldPR = Array.fill(n)( 0.0 )
 * while( max(abs(PR - oldPr)) > tol ) {
 *   swap(oldPR, PR)
 *   for( i <- 0 until n if abs(PR[i] - oldPR[i]) > tol ) {
 *     PR[i] = alpha + (1 - \alpha) * inNbrs[i].map(j => oldPR[j] / outDeg[j]).sum
 *   }
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * `alpha` is the random reset probability (typically 0.15), `inNbrs[i]` is the set of
 * neighbors which link to `i` and `outDeg[j]` is the out degree of vertex `j`.
 *
 * Note that this is not the "normalized" PageRank and as a consequence pages that have no
 * inlinks will have a PageRank of alpha. In particular, the pageranks may have some values
 * greater than 1.
 *
 * The resulting vertices DataFrame contains one additional column:
 *  - pagerank (`DoubleType`): the pagerank of this vertex
 *
 * The resulting edges DataFrame contains one additional column:
 *  - weight (`DoubleType`): the normalized weight of this edge after running PageRank
