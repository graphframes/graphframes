/**
 * Parallel Personalized PageRank algorithm implementation.
 *
 * This implementation uses the standalone [[GraphFrame]] interface and
 * runs personalized PageRank in parallel for a fixed number of iterations.
 * This can be run by setting `maxIter`.
 * The source vertex Ids are set in `sourceIds`.
 * A simple local implementation of this algorithm is as follows.
 * {{{
 * var oldPR = Array.fill(n)( 1.0 )
 * val PR = (0 until n).map(i => if sourceIds.contains(i) alpha else 0.0)
 * for( iter <- 0 until maxIter ) {
 *   swap(oldPR, PR)
 *   for( i <- 0 until n ) {
 *     PR[i] = (1 - alpha) * inNbrs[i].map(j => oldPR[j] / outDeg[j]).sum
 *     if (sourceIds.contains(i)) PR[i] += alpha
 *   }
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * `alpha` is the random reset probability (typically 0.15), `inNbrs[i]` is the set of
 * neighbors which link to `i` and `outDeg[j]` is the out degree of vertex `j`.
 *
 * Note that this is not the "normalized" PageRank and as a consequence pages that have no
 * inlinks will have a PageRank of alpha. In particular, the pageranks may have some values
 * greater than 1.
 *
 * The resulting vertices DataFrame contains one additional column:
 *  - pageranks (`VectorType`): the pageranks of this vertex from all input source vertices
 *
 * The resulting edges DataFrame contains one additional column:
 *  - weight (`DoubleType`): the normalized weight of this edge after running PageRank
