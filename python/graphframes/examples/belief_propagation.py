    """Example code for Belief Propagation (BP)

    This provides a template for building customized BP algorithms for different types of graphical
    models.

    This example:

    * Ising model on a grid
    * Parallel Belief Propagation using colored fields

    Ising models are probabilistic graphical models over binary variables
    (see :meth:`Graphs.gridIsingModel()`).

    Belief Propagation (BP) provides marginal probabilities of the values of the variables
    x\ :sub:`i` i.e., P(x\ :sub:`i`) for each i.  This allows a user to understand likely values of
    variables. See `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief_propagation>`__ for more
    information on BP.

    We use a batch synchronous BP algorithm, where batches of vertices are updated synchronously.
    We follow the mean field update algorithm in Slide 13 of the
    `talk slides <http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wainwrig/Talks/A_GraphModel_Tutorial>`__ from:
    Wainwright. "Graphical models, message-passing algorithms, and convex optimization."

    The batches are chosen according to a coloring. For background on graph colorings for
    inference, see for example: Gonzalez et al. "Parallel Gibbs Sampling: From Colored Fields to
    Thin Junction Trees." AISTATS, 2011.

    The BP algorithm works by:

    * Coloring the graph by assigning a color to each vertex such that no neighboring vertices
      share the same color.
    * In each step of BP, update all vertices of a single color.  Alternate colors.
