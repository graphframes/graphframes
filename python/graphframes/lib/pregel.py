class Pregel(JavaWrapper):
    """Implements a Pregel-like bulk-synchronous message-passing API based on DataFrame operations.

    See `Malewicz et al., Pregel: a system for large-scale graph processing <https://doi.org/10.1145/1807167.1807184>`_
    for a detailed description of the Pregel algorithm.

    You can construct a Pregel instance using either this constructor or :attr:`graphframes.GraphFrame.pregel`,
    then use builder pattern to describe the operations, and then call :func:`run` to start a run.
    It returns a DataFrame of vertices from the last iteration.

    When a run starts, it expands the vertices DataFrame using column expressions defined by :func:`withVertexColumn`.
    Those additional vertex properties can be changed during Pregel iterations.
    In each Pregel iteration, there are three phases:
      - Given each edge triplet, generate messages and specify target vertices to send,
        described by :func:`sendMsgToDst` and :func:`sendMsgToSrc`.
      - Aggregate messages by target vertex IDs, described by :func:`aggMsgs`.
      - Update additional vertex properties based on aggregated messages and states from previous iteration,
        described by :func:`withVertexColumn`.

    Please find what columns you can reference at each phase in the method API docs.

    You can control the number of iterations by :func:`setMaxIter` and check API docs for advanced controls.
